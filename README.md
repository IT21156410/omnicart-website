# React + TypeScript + Vite Web Application - Omnicart

### **EAD SE4040 - ASSIGNMENT**

This repository contains the **Omnicart** web application, which handles user management, product management, inventory management, and vendor management. The system is built using **ASP.NET Core** and includes a RESTful API to manage products, vendors, users, and notifications. Additionally, it covers mobile application features through API endpoints that allow customers to browse and purchase products.

## Project Scenario

It includes functionality for **administrators**, **vendors**, and **customer service representatives (CSR)**, enabling them to manage users, products, orders, and inventory efficiently. Customers can browse products, place orders, and manage their accounts through the web and mobile applications. The system includes inventory tracking with notifications for low stock and manages the entire product lifecycle, from creation to sale.
