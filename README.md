# React + TypeScript + Vite Web Application - Omnicart

### **EAD SE4040 - ASSIGNMENT**

This repository contains the **Omnicart** web application, which handles user management, product management, inventory management, and vendor management. The system is built using **ASP.NET Core** and includes a RESTful API to manage products, vendors, users, and notifications. Additionally, it covers mobile application features through API endpoints that allow customers to browse and purchase products.

## Project Scenario

The **Omnicart** system aims to facilitate the management of an e-commerce platform. It includes functionality for **administrators**, **vendors**, and **customer service representatives (CSR)**, enabling them to manage users, products, orders, and inventory efficiently. Customers can browse products, place orders, and manage their accounts through the web and mobile applications. The system includes inventory tracking with notifications for low stock and manages the entire product lifecycle, from creation to sale.

## Assignment Details

### 1. **User Management**
   - **Create and manage users** with distinct roles: Administrator, Vendor, and CSR.
   - Only **Administrators** can access functions related to managing vendors and inventory.

### 2. **Product Management**
   - **Vendors** can create, update, and delete products using a unique Product ID.
   - Product deletion is restricted if the product is part of any pending orders.
   - Vendors can **activate and deactivate** product listings.

### 3. **Inventory Management**
   - Track inventory levels for each product and **generate alerts** for low stock levels.
   - Notifications are sent to vendors when their product stock is low.
   - Vendors can automatically manage stock levels based on the number of available items.
   - Stock cannot be removed for products that are part of pending orders.

### 4. **Vendor Management**
   - **Vendor creation** is managed by the Administrator.
   - Vendors are responsible for managing product listings and inventory levels.

### 5. **Mobile Application (API)**
   - **Customer Account Management**:
     - Customers can modify and deactivate their accounts.
     - Accounts must be activated by either the Administrator or CSR before they can log in to the mobile application.
     - CSR can deactivate and reactivate accounts.
   - **Product Browsing and Purchasing**:
     - Customers can browse products by category, search for items, and view detailed product information.
     - Filtering and sorting based on **price**, **vendor**, **ratings**, and **product category** are provided.

### 6. **Notifications**
   - Notifications are sent to **Vendors** when their product stock is low or when important product updates occur.
   - Notifications for account-related activities (such as **account creation** or **activation**) are sent to **CSRs** for approval.
