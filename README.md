It includes functionality for **administrators**, **vendors**, and **customer service representatives (CSR)**, enabling them to manage users, products, orders, and inventory efficiently. Customers can browse products, place orders, and manage their accounts through the web and mobile applications. The system includes inventory tracking with notifications for low stock and manages the entire product lifecycle, from creation to sale.
